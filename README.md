# Experiment Description 

This Monte Carlo experiment simulates the conditions for focus by demonstrating the effect of impulses crossing the synapse to a single receiving neuron.  Focus is achieved when one impulse originating in a neuron is strong enough to traverse the synaptic cleft between neurons thereby moving the impulse into a state of deeper processing.  This happens at large scale in organic brains and can be simulated bit-wise in synthetic consciousness through the use of a binary system, where a ‘0’ indicates no impulses crossing a synaptic cleft, and a ‘1’ indicates an impulse strong enough to traverse the synaptic cleft.

In this experiment, the focus is achieved when only 1 impulse is strong enough to traverse the synaptic cleft (indicated by an iteration containing a ‘0’ and a‘1’).  Iterations containing multiple’1s’ indicate the reception of multiple impulses that can cause disruption or confusion.  An iteration with no ‘1s’ indicates a lack of stimulus to create impulses strong enough to traverse the synaptic gap.  

In this experiment, the simulated focus of the synthetic consciousness emulates an additive XOR cypher, an encryption algorithm fundamental to creating and conducting transactions on the blockchain.
